# Imgik

Experiment on building a cli to process images doing most things from stratch. I'll keep expanding as I go along learning
right now it only handles `png` since it's the easiest one.

Extensions:
- [x] png
- [] jpg
- [] gif

Filters:
- [x] red
- [x] inversion
- [x] quantize?(I'm just rounding the pixels)
- [x] mean 
- [] gaussian blur?
...tbd

Alterations:
- [] cut image borders?
